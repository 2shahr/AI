In this assignment, you are about to implement a Feating ensemble. Feating (Feature Subspace
Aggregating) subdivides the feature-space into non-overlapping local regions in a single subdivision; and
ensures that different subdivisions provide the distinct local neighborhoods for each point in the feature
space. There are many ways a feature-space can be subdivided. Instead of using heuristics, Feating
subdivides the feature-space exhaustively based on a user-specified number of features to control the
level of localisation. The set of exhaustive feature-space subdivisions forms the basis to develop a new
ensemble method which aggregates all local models or a random subset of these local models.
