In this assignment, you will implement solutions to two problems associated with HMMs: the Viterbi
algorithm, and the Forward-Backward algorithm. The Viterbi algorithm is used for supervised tasks and
the Forward-Backward algorithm is employed for semi-supervised, and unsupervised tasks. A hidden
Markov model (HMM) allows us to talk about both observed events (e.g. words) and hidden events (e.g.
part-of-speech tags).
